This is task 4 of Oasis Infobyte | Data Science Domain.

In this Project, use Python to build an email spam detector. Then, use machine learning to train the spam detector to recognize and classify emails into spam and non-spam. Letâ€™s get started!

ðŸ“§Email Spam Detection With Machine LearningðŸ“¨ 

Exploring spam detection using Logistic Regression to classify SMS messages as spam or ham. This project highlights the importance of preprocessing text data and utilizing machine learning models for efficient classification.

Project Highlights:

â€¢Utilized a spam dataset to classify messages.
â€¢Preprocessed text data by handling missing values and converting text to numerical form using TfidfVectorizer.
â€¢Applied Logistic Regression to train and test the model.
â€¢Evaluated the model's performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

Steps Involved:

â€¢Load and explore the dataset.
â€¢Check and handle missing values by removing columns with high percentage of missing data.
â€¢Rename columns for clarity.
â€¢Convert categorical labels (spam/ham) to numerical labels.
â€¢Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
â€¢Convert text data into numerical form using TfidfVectorizer.
â€¢Train a Logistic Regression model on the training data.
â€¢Evaluate the model's performance on the test data using various metrics.

Key Takeaway:

ðŸ”‘This project demonstrates the effectiveness of text preprocessing and logistic regression in accurately classifying SMS messages as spam or ham, emphasizing the importance of data cleaning and feature extraction in text-based machine learning tasks.ðŸ’¡
